Extra Questions

1)What is LILO?
LILO (Linux Loader) is a boot loader for Linux. It is used to load Linux into memory and start the operating system. LILO can be configured to boot other operating systems as well. LILO is customizable, i.e., if the default configuration is not correct, it can be changed. The config file for LILO is lilo.conf. LILO is also a code snippet that loads PC BIOS into the main memory at the time of starting the computer system.

It handles the following tasks:

Locating Linux kernel
Identifying other supporting programs and loading them in memory
Starting the kernel
The selection of various Kernel images and boot routines is supported by LILO. For this reason, it is known as the boot manager.
